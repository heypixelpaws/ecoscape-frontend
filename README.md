This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Git Push to Pixelpaws

To push your changes to the `pixelpaws` remote, use the following command:

```bash
git push pixelpaws main
```

### Guidelines for Pushing to Pixelpaws

- Ensure your local `main` branch is up-to-date with the `pixelpaws/main` before pushing.
- Always commit your changes with clear and descriptive messages.
- If you encounter merge conflicts, resolve them locally before pushing.
- Avoid pushing directly to `main` if working on a feature; prefer creating a new branch and then merging via a Pull Request.
